## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

MIT license. In short: go nuts, but give credit where credit is due.

Please see the included LICENSE.txt for the legalese.

## DETAILS

This is a Plugin for [Athanor](https://github.com/volundmush/athanor) which provides BBS system akin to Myrddin's BBS from classical MUX/MUSHes.

## FEATURES
* Board Collections to group boards together under a common prefix.
* Customizable permissions for each Collection, Board, and admin controls.
* Reply system.
* Pagination of large post collections.
* Boards can be IC or OOC - IC boards can only be used while logged into a character. OOC boards use Accounts.
* Boards can be made pseudo-anonymous from player perspective for roleplay purposes.


## OKAY, BUT HOW DO I USE IT?
Glad you asked!

If you haven't already, you'll need to install Evennia and Athanor. Follow the instructions at [Athanor](https://github.com/volundmush/athanor) about that.

Then, you can install athanor_boards using ```pip install git+git://github.com/volundmush/athanor_boards```

Once installed, the plugin must be added to your athanor.init() call in settings.py. It should look something like this:

```python
import athanor as _athanor, sys as _sys
_athanor.init(_sys.modules[__name__], plugins=[
    "athanor_factions",
    "athanor_boards"
])
```

Afterwards, you'll need to run evennia migrate athanor_boards to create the database tables.

Once that's done, reload Evennia and the commands should be accessible.

## FAQ 
  __Q:__ This is cool! How can I help?  
  __A:__ [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/volund) support is always welcome. If you can code and have cool ideas or bug fixes, feel free to fork, edit, and pull request! Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/Sxuz3QNU8U) to really get cranking away though.

  __Q:__ I found a bug! What do I do?  
  __A:__ Post it on this GitHub's Issues tracker. I'll see what I can do when I have time. ... or you can try to fix it yourself and submit a Pull Request. That's cool too.

  __Q:__ The heck is an Athanor? Why name something this?
  __A:__ An Athanor is a furnace used in alchemy. It's a place where things are forged and refined. I thought it was a fitting name for a library that's meant to be used to build other things.
